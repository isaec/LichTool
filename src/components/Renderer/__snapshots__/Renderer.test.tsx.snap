        The goal of this system is to emulate the look and feel of the books, while maintaining a convenient and consistent data structure that can be re-used.
      </p>
      <p>
        The general format is to nest multiple levels of 'entries'-typed objects, with other specific types (described in detail below) used as needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        String entries can contain tags, and these work when nested in most other structures. These will eventually all work with the hover-to-view feature. They are case-insensitive, unless otherwise noted. These are:

                Another tag that appears occasionally in the data is the @filter tag. This tag can be tricky to use, and generally relies on knowledge of the internals of each page. As such, use with caution, and if you're not sure about something, don't be afraid to drop by our 
                <a
                  href="https://discord.gg/5etools"
                  rel="noopener noreferrer"
                  target="_blank"
                >
                  Discord
                </a>
                 and ask questions.
              </p>
              <p>
                The syntax for the @filter tag is as follows:
              </p>
              <p>
                (open curly brace)@filter display text|page_without_file_extension|filter_name_1=filter_1_value_1;filter_1_value_2;...filter_1_value_n|...|filter_name_m=filter_m_value_1;filter_m_value_2;...(close curly brace)
              </p>
              <p>
                The purpose of this tag is to open the given page, pre-filtered with the specified filtering options. There's one major caveat that makes this tricky to use for aspiring JSONtranauts—the filter values use the 
                <i>
                  internal
                </i>
                 version, as you'd find in the data. So, for example, ..|school=D|.. would filter spells to Divination school spells, as 'D' is the Divination identifier in the data. Trying to do e.g. ..|school=Divination|.. will not work.
              </p>
              <p>
                The 'filter_name_X' here matches the literal text name of the filter, as displayed in the dropdown.
              </p>
              <p>

              <p>
                Adventure and book content supports "area" tags, which have the form \`@area [area name]|[entry id]\` or \`@area [area name]|[entry id]|[modifiers]\` where [modifiers] is a combination of "x" for e[x]act text, and "u" for [u]ppercase. The "exact" modifier removes the leading "area " which is prepended to the area name, and the "uppercase" modifier causes the prepended text to "Area ".
              </p>
              <p>
                A variety of entries blocks can have "id" fields (and may therefore be linked to with "area" tags), notable "entries"-type, "section"-type, and "inset"-type. These IDs are conventionally 3-digit hexadecimal numbers (allowing for a total of 4096 IDs per adventure/book), but any string which is unique within the document will suffice.
